# Python_Auto-filler

This set of tools is designed to work together seamlessly, making the whole process of filling out forms incredibly simple. Think of it like a three-step journey. The first step is to use the Auto-Detector script (autodetect_fields.py). You just show it the form you want to fill and the file with your data, and it acts like a smart assistant, automatically figuring out which data column goes into which form box. It then creates a "map" file for you, so you don't have to do any tedious setup work yourself. This clever first step prepares everything you need for the actual automation.
Once you have your map file, you have two great options for the second step. If you like to see what's happening, you can open the GUI (gui.py), which is a simple window with buttons. You just click to load your data and the map file, then hit "Start," and you can watch the progress live in a log box. On the other hand, if you're a developer or want this to be part of a bigger automated process, you can use the Command-Line tool (main.py). This lets you run the same task silently in the background. This combination of an automatic setup tool and a choice of interfaces makes the entire suite powerful enough for experts but still easy enough for anyone to use.
